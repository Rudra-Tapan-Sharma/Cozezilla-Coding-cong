ðŸ“Š Price Flow Dashboard â€“ README
Price Flow Dashboard is a dynamic pricing e-commerce interface that allows businesses to manage and optimize product pricing based on market data. It provides essential tools for price updates, analytics, and decision-making.

ðŸ”§ Features
â€¢	Product Management: Add, delete, and display products dynamically with base price, current price, and SKU.
â€¢	Dynamic Pricing: Automatically recommends prices based on demand, competitor price, and inventory.
â€¢	Live Market Chart: Simulated live chart of clothing market prices using Chart.js.
â€¢	Dark Mode Toggle: Easily switch between dark and light themes.
â€¢	A/B Testing: Basic simulation of testing different pricing strategies.
â€¢	Image Upload: Upload and preview product images.
â€¢	Persistent Default Products: Default products load on every page refresh.
Technologies Used:
â€¢	HTML, CSS, JavaScript
â€¢	Chart.js for graphs

How the Code Works:
The website uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. On page load (window.onload), five default product cards are dynamically added using JavaScript. 
Users can add new products via a modal form, which gets appended to the product section. A Chart.js graph simulates live market trends, updating periodically.
Dark mode toggles the entire theme using a CSS class switch. All user interactions are handled through event listeners, and core features like price change percentage and A/B testing are computed in real time.
